                    In his speech at the Stanford commencement, Steve Jobs said that "<i>Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward ... But it was very, very clear looking backwards</i>". That is why I always strive to learn and accomplish as much as I can. Here is what I've done so far in my 16 years of life.

                    Being a music student at Cardinal Carter Academy for the Arts, I usually spend around one to three hours a day playing flute. However, high academic achievements is also what I am striving for in high school. In Grade 10, I have achieved an overall average of 95%. Furthermore, for two consecutive years at Carter, I was able to receive the mathematical academic award of my grade.

                    Since the first time I programmed two years ago, I fell in love with this unique form of art. Last year, I participated in the Canadian Computing Contest for the first time and was placed on the University of Waterloo Honour Roll. As well, I have made various projects in different languages in my free time, including this website that you are seeing. For more information on my coding obsession, <a class="thingsLink" id="thingsNav">this section</a> of my website has a more detailed overview of it.

                    <a class="thingsLink" href="http://www.ccas.toronto.on.ca">Catholic Children's Aid Society</a> is an organization that helps the struggling families and children in my community. I have been fortunate enough to be a volunteer tutor at this organization for the past three years. Every week, I attend the Homework Club program and tutor children from less wealthy families who are struggling with academic and behavioural issues. During my work here, I have encountered many of the less fortunate in my community and have learnt how important it is for us to help those who are in need.

				<div class="thingsInfo">
                    For those of you who don't know what Hackathons are, simply put, it is a gathering of coders (usually university students) who have decided to code for 24 to 48 hours straight (usually with the help of caffeine) with the goal of producing an innovative and more importantly, fun product. In the latest Hackathon I went to, Electric City Hacks, my team and I created a social media mobile application integrated with augmented reality and was fortunate enough to receive the title of Best Adventure Hacks. Check out our app here on my <a class="thingsLink" href="https://devpost.com/software/memory-hunter">Devpost!</a>

				<div class="thingsInfo">
                    Since my school is very art-oriented, I was not surprised to see the lack of a computer-related club. Having decided to take the responsibility upon myself, I founded a Coding Club at my high school in the beginning of Grade 11. In this club, I teach my peers the beauty and power of HTML, CSS, and Javascript in web development. Currently, my club has around 15 members who attend weekly meetings.

                    In the summer of 2017, I was fortunate enough to be accepted into one of the most well-known STEM-themed summer camp in Canada, <a class="thingsLink" href="https://www.shad.ca">SHAD</a>. There, I experienced university lectures first-hand, met some extremely inspirational people, and developed friendship that I hope will be life-long. As well, my team and I created CanSave, a product that can help Canadian household reduce energy footprint.

                    Throughout the first first six months of 2017, I joined The Knowledge Society Toronto as an innovator. During our weekly meetings, we discussed the most cutting-edge technologies in the world including CRISPR-CAS9, Natural Language Processing, etc. By the time the program ended, I became very interested in cryptography was accepted to make a speech about it by my program coordinator.

                A programmer doesn't need to know everything, but a programmer always knows what to learn and how to learn it. After asking countless "stupid" questions on the lifesaving site called StackOverflow and checking the endless, messy, unreliable GitHub open source code, here is all the knowledge I am able to gather and absorb in the past three years.
